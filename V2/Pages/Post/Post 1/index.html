                    Elon Reeve Musk FRS (/ˈiːlɒn/ EE-lon; born June 28, 1971) is a
                    business magnate and investor. He is the founder, CEO, and chief
                    engineer of SpaceX; angel investor, CEO and product architect of
                    Tesla, Inc.; founder of the Boring Company; co-founder of Neuralink
                    and OpenAI; president of the Musk Foundation; and owner and CEO of
                    Twitter, Inc. With an estimated net worth of around $195 billion as
                    of November 4, 2022,[4] Musk is the wealthiest person in the world
                    according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index and Forbes's real-time
                    billionaires list.[5][6]

                    Musk was born and grew up in Pretoria, South Africa. He attended the
                    University of Pretoria before moving to Canada at age 17, acquiring
                    citizenship through his Canadian-born mother. Two years later, he
                    matriculated at Queen's University and transferred to the University
                    of Pennsylvania, where he received bachelor's degrees in economics
                    and physics. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford
                    University but decided to instead pursue a business career,
                    co-founding the web software company Zip2 with his brother, Kimbal.
                    The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999. The
                    same year, Musk co-founded the online bank X.com, which merged with
                    Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal. eBay bought PayPal in 2002 for
                    $1.5 billion.

                <li>
                    In 2002, Musk founded SpaceX, an aerospace manufacturer and space
                    transport services company, and is its CEO and chief engineer. In
                    2004, he was an early investor in the electric vehicle manufacturer
                    Tesla Motors, Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.). He became its chairman and
                    product architect, eventually assuming the position of CEO in 2008.
                    In 2006, he helped create SolarCity, a solar energy company that was
                    later acquired by Tesla and became Tesla Energy. In 2015, he
                    co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit research company promoting friendly
                    artificial intelligence. In 2016, he co-founded Neuralink, a
                    neurotechnology company focused on developing brain–computer
                    interfaces, and he founded the Boring Company, a tunnel construction
                    company. In 2022, Musk purchased the social media platform Twitter
                    for $44 billion. He has proposed a hyperloop high-speed vactrain
                    transportation system and is the president of the Musk Foundation,
                    which donates to scientific research and education.

                <li>
                    Musk has promoted contentious perspectives regarding politics and
                    various technologies, especially on Twitter. He has also been
                    criticized for making unscientific statements, such as spreading
                    COVID-19 misinformation. In 2018, the U.S. Securities and Exchange
                    Commission (SEC) sued Musk for tweeting that he had secured funding
                    for a private takeover of Tesla, which the SEC characterized as
                    false and misleading. He settled with the SEC but did not admit
                    guilt, and he temporarily stepped down from his Tesla chairmanship.
                    In 2019, he won a defamation case brought against him by a British
                    caver who had advised the Tham Luang cave rescue.

                    Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, one of the
                    capital cities of South Africa,[7][8] and was baptized into the
                    Anglican church.[9] Musk has British and Pennsylvania Dutch
                    ancestry.[10][11] His mother is Maye Musk (née Haldeman), a model
                    and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada, and raised in South
                    Africa.[12][13][14] His father, Errol Musk, is a South African
                    electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, and property
                    developer, who was a half-owner of a Zambian emerald mine near Lake
                    Tanganyika.[15][16][17][18] Musk has a younger brother, Kimbal,
                    (born 1972) and a younger sister, Tosca, (born 1974).[14][19]

                <li>
                    Musk's family was wealthy during his youth.[18] His father was
                    elected to the Pretoria City Council as a representative of the
                    anti-apartheid Progressive Party, with his children sharing their
                    father's dislike of apartheid.[7] His maternal grandfather, Joshua
                    Haldeman, was an adventurous American-born Canadian who took his
                    family on record-breaking journeys to Africa and Australia in a
                    single-engine Bellanca airplane.[20][21][22] After his parents
                    divorced in 1980, Musk mostly lived with his father.[10] Musk later
                    regretted his decision because he has become estranged from his
                    father.[23] He has a paternal half-sister and a
                    half-brother.[20][24]

                <li>
                    In his biography of Musk, Ashlee Vance described Musk as an awkward
                    and introverted child.[25] When Musk was age ten, he developed an
                    interest in computing and video games, teaching himself how to
                    program from his Commodore VIC-20 user manual.[26] At age twelve, he
                    sold his BASIC-based game Blastar to PC and Office Technology
                    magazine for approximately $500.[27][28]

                    Musk attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School, Bryanston High
                    School, and Pretoria Boys High School, from which he graduated.[29]
                    Musk applied for a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born
                    mother,[30][31] knowing that it would be easier to immigrate to the
                    United States this way.[32] While waiting for his application to be
                    processed, he attended the University of Pretoria for five months;
                    this allowed him to avoid mandatory service in the South African
                    Defence Force.[33]

                    Musk arrived in Canada in June 1989 and lived with a second cousin
                    in Saskatchewan for a year,[34] working odd jobs at a farm and
                    lumber-mill.[35] In 1990, he entered Queen's University in Kingston,
                    Ontario.[36][37] Two years later, he transferred to the University
                    of Pennsylvania, where he completed studies for a Bachelor of Arts
                    degree in physics and a Bachelor of Science degree in economics from
                    the Wharton School in 1995.[38][39] He reportedly hosted large,
                    ticketed house parties to help pay for tuition, and wrote a business
                    plan for an electronic book-scanning service similar to Google
                    Books.[40]

                    In 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley: one at the
                    energy storage startup Pinnacle Research Institute, which
                    investigated electrolytic ultracapacitors for energy storage, and
                    another at the Palo Alto–based startup Rocket Science Games.[41][42]
                    In 1995, he was accepted to a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) program in
                    materials science at Stanford University.[43] However, Musk decided
                    to join the Internet boom instead[44] and applied for a job at
                    Netscape, to which he reportedly never received a response.[30]

                    early business experience during a 2014 commencement speech at USC

                    Zip2.[45][46] Errol Musk provided them with $28,000 in funding.[47]
                    The company developed an Internet city guide with maps, directions,
                    and yellow pages, and marketed it to newspapers.[48] They worked at
                    a small rented office in Palo Alto,[49] Musk coding the website
                    every night.[49] Eventually, Zip2 obtained contracts with The New
                    York Times and the Chicago Tribune.[40] The brothers persuaded the
                    board of directors to abandon a merger with CitySearch;[50] however,
                    Musk's attempts to become CEO were thwarted.[51] Compaq acquired
                    Zip2 for $307 million in cash in February 1999,[52][53] and Musk
                    received $22 million for his 7-percent share.[54]

                    Later in 1999, Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services
                    and e-mail payment company.[55] X.com was one of the first federally
                    insured online banks and over 200,000 customers joined after its
                    initial months of operation.[56] Even though Musk founded the
                    company, investors regarded him as inexperienced and replaced him
                    with Intuit CEO Bill Harris by the end of the year.[57]

                <li>
                    In 2000, X.com merged with online bank Confinity to avoid
                    competition,[49][57][58] as Confinity's money-transfer service
                    PayPal was more popular than X.com's service.[59] Musk then returned
                    as CEO of the merged company. His preference for Microsoft over
                    Unix-based software caused a rift among the company's employees, and
                    led Peter Thiel, Confinity's founder, to resign.[60] With the
                    company suffering from compounding technological issues and the lack
                    of a cohesive business model, the board ousted Musk and replaced him
                    with Thiel in September 2000.[61][b] Under Thiel, the company
                    focused on the money-transfer service and was renamed PayPal in
                    2001.[63][64]

                    In 2002, PayPal was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in stock, of
                    which Musk—the largest shareholder with 11.72% of shares—received
                    $175.8 million.[65][66] In 2017, more than one and a half decades
                    later, Musk purchased the X.com domain from PayPal for its
                    sentimental value.[67][68] In 2022, Musk discussed a goal of
                    creating "X, the everything app".[69]

                    In early 2001, Musk became involved with the nonprofit Mars Society
                    and discussed funding plans to place a growth-chamber for plants on
                    Mars.[70] In October of the same year, he traveled to Moscow with
                    Jim Cantrell and Adeo Ressi to buy refurbished intercontinental
                    ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that could send the greenhouse payloads
                    into space. He met with the companies NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras;
                    however, Musk was seen as a novice[71] and the group returned to the
                    United States empty-handed. In February 2002, the group returned to
                    Russia with Mike Griffin (president of In-Q-Tel) to look for three
                    ICBMs. They had another meeting with Kosmotras and were offered one
                    rocket for $8 million, which Musk rejected. He instead decided to
                    start a company that could build affordable rockets.[71] With $100
                    million of his own money,[72] Musk founded SpaceX in May 2002 and
                    became the company's CEO and Chief Engineer.[73][74]

                    SpaceX attempted its first launch of the Falcon 1 rocket in
                    2006.[75] Though the rocket failed to reach Earth orbit, it was
                    awarded a Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program
                    contract from NASA Administrator (and former SpaceX consultant[76])
                    Mike Griffin later that year.[77][78] After two more failed attempts
                    that nearly caused Musk and his companies to go bankrupt,[75] SpaceX
                    succeeded in launching the Falcon 1 into orbit in 2008.[79] Later
                    that year, SpaceX received a $1.6 billion Commercial Resupply
                    Services contract from NASA for 12 flights of its Falcon 9 rocket
                    and Dragon spacecraft to the International Space Station, replacing
                    the Space Shuttle after its 2011 retirement.[80] In 2012, the Dragon
                    vehicle docked with the ISS, a first for a commercial
                    spacecraft.[81] Musk credited the NASA award, one of the last
                    actions by Mike Griffin as NASA Administrator, for saving the
                    company.[82]

                    Working towards its goal of reusable rockets, in 2015 SpaceX
                    successfully landed the first stage of a Falcon 9 on an inland
                    platform.[83] Later landings were achieved on autonomous spaceport
                    drone ships, an ocean-based recovery platform.[84] In 2018, SpaceX
                    launched the Falcon Heavy; the inaugural mission carried Musk's
                    personal Tesla Roadster as a dummy payload.[85][86] Since 2019,[87]
                    SpaceX has been developing Starship, a fully-reusable,
                    super-heavy-lift launch vehicle intended to replace the Falcon 9 and
                    the Falcon Heavy.[88] In 2020, SpaceX launched its first crewed
                    flight, the Demo-2, becoming the first private company to place
                    astronauts into orbit and dock a crewed spacecraft with the ISS.[89]

                    In 2015, SpaceX began development of the Starlink constellation of
                    low-Earth-orbit satellites to provide satellite Internet access,[90]
                    with the first two prototype satellites launched in February 2018. A
                    second set of test satellites, and the first large deployment of a
                    piece of the constellation, occurred in May 2019, when the first 60
                    operational satellites were launched.[91] The total cost of the
                    decade-long project to design, build, and deploy the constellation
                    is estimated by SpaceX to be about $10 billion.[92][c] Some critics,
                    including the International Astronomical Union, have alleged that
                    Starlink blocks the view of the sky and poses a collision threat to
                    spacecraft.[95][96][97]

                    During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Musk sent Starlink
                    terminals to Ukraine to provide Internet access and
                    communication,[98] an action praised by Ukrainian president
                    Volodymyr Zelenskyy.[99][100] However, Musk refused to block Russian
                    state media on Starlink, declaring himself "a free speech
                    absolutist".[101][102] In October 2022, Musk stated that about
                    20,000 satellite terminals had been donated to Ukraine, together
                    with free data transfer subscriptions, which cost SpaceX $80
                    million. After first asking the United States Department of Defense
                    to pay for further units and future subscriptions on behalf of
                    Ukraine,[103] Musk publicly stated SpaceX would continue to offer
                    Starlink products and services to the Ukrainian government for free,
                    at a cost he estimated at $400 million for the following 12
                    months.[104][105][106]

                    Tesla, Inc.—originally Tesla Motors—was incorporated in 2003 by
                    Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, who financed the company until
                    the Series A round of funding.[107] Both men played active roles in
                    the company's early development prior to Musk's involvement.[108]
                    Musk led the Series A round of investment in February 2004; he
                    invested $6.5 million, became the majority shareholder, and joined
                    Tesla's board of directors as chairman.[109] Musk took an active
                    role within the company and oversaw Roadster product design but was
                    not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.[110]

                    Following a series of escalating conflicts in 2007, and the 2008
                    financial crisis, Eberhard was ousted from the firm.[111][page
                    needed][112] Musk assumed leadership of the company as CEO and
                    product architect in 2008.[113] A 2009 lawsuit settlement with
                    Eberhard designated Musk as a Tesla co-founder, along with
                    Tarpenning and two others.[114][115] As of 2019, Musk was the
                    longest-tenured CEO of any automotive manufacturer globally.[116] In
                    2021, Musk nominally changed his title to "Technoking" while
                    retaining his position as CEO.[117]

                    Tesla first built an electric sports car, the Roadster, in 2008.
                    With sales of about 2,500 vehicles, it was the first serial
                    production all-electric car to use lithium-ion battery cells.[118]
                    Tesla began delivery of its four-door Model S sedan in 2012.[119] A
                    cross-over, the Model X was launched in 2015.[120] A mass-market
                    sedan, the Model 3, was released in 2017.[121] The Model 3 is the
                    all-time bestselling plug-in electric car worldwide, and in June
                    2021 it became the first electric car to sell 1 million units
                    globally.[122][123] A fifth vehicle, the Model Y crossover, was
                    launched in 2020.[124] The Cybertruck, an all-electric pickup truck,
                    was unveiled in 2019.[125] Under Musk, Tesla has also constructed
                    multiple lithium-ion battery and electric vehicle factories, named
                    Gigafactories.[126]

                    Since its initial public offering in 2010,[127] Tesla stock has
                    risen significantly; it became the most valuable carmaker in summer
                    2020,[128][129] and it entered the S&P 500 later that
                    year.[130][131] In October 2021, it reached a market capitalization
                    of $1 trillion, the sixth company in U.S. history to do so.[132] In
                    November 2021, Musk proposed, on Twitter, to sell 10% of his Tesla
                    stock, since "much is made lately of unrealized gains being a means
                    of tax avoidance".[133] After more than 3.5 million Twitter accounts
                    supported the sale, Musk sold $6.9 billion of Tesla stock within a
                    week,[133] and a total of $16.4 billion by year end, reaching the
                    10% target.[134] In February 2022, The Wall Street Journal reported
                    that both Elon and Kimbal Musk were under investigation by the SEC
                    for possible insider trading related to the sale.[135] In 2022, Musk
                    unveiled a robot developed by Tesla, Optimus.[136]

                <li>
                    In 2018, Musk was sued by the SEC for a tweet claiming that funding
                    had been secured for potentially taking Tesla private.[137][d] The
                    lawsuit characterized the tweet as false, misleading, and damaging
                    to investors, and sought to bar Musk from serving as CEO of publicly
                    traded companies.[137][141][142] Two days later, Musk settled with
                    the SEC, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations. As a
                    result, Musk and Tesla were fined $20 million each, and Musk was
                    forced to step down for three years as Tesla chairman but was able
                    to remain as CEO.[143] Musk has stated in interviews that he does
                    not regret posting the tweet that triggered the SEC
                    investigation.[144][145] In April 2022, the shareholder who sued
                    Musk over the tweet, along with several Tesla shareholders, said
                    that a federal judge had ruled that the tweet was false, although
                    the ruling in question has not been unsealed.[146]

                <li>
                    In 2019, Musk stated in a tweet that Tesla would build half a
                    million cars that year.[147] The SEC reacted to Musk's tweet by
                    filing in court, asking the court to hold him in contempt for
                    violating the terms of a settlement agreement with such a tweet; the
                    accusation was disputed by Musk. This was eventually settled by a
                    joint agreement between Musk and the SEC clarifying the previous
                    agreement details.[148] The agreement included a list of topics that
                    Musk would need preclearance before tweeting about.[149] In 2020, a
                    judge prevented a lawsuit from proceeding that claimed a tweet by
                    Musk regarding Tesla stock price ("too high imo") violated the
                    agreement.[150][151] FOIA-released records showed that the SEC
                    itself concluded Musk has subsequently violated the agreement twice
                    by tweeting regarding "Tesla's solar roof production volumes and its
                    stock price".[152]

                    Musk provided the initial concept and financial capital for
                    SolarCity, which his cousins Lyndon and Peter Rive founded in
                    2006.[153] By 2013, SolarCity was the second largest provider of
                    solar power systems in the United States.[154] In 2014, Musk
                    promoted the idea of SolarCity building an advanced production
                    facility in Buffalo, New York, triple the size of the largest solar
                    plant in the United States.[155] Construction of the factory started
                    in 2014 and was completed in 2017. It operated as a joint venture
                    with Panasonic until early 2020.[156][157]

                    Tesla acquired SolarCity for over $2 billion in 2016 and merged it
                    with its battery unit to create Tesla Energy. The deal's
                    announcement resulted in a more than 10% drop in Tesla's stock
                    price. At the time, SolarCity was facing liquidity issues.[158]
                    Multiple shareholder groups filed a lawsuit against Musk and Tesla's
                    directors, claiming that the purchase of SolarCity was done solely
                    to benefit Musk and came at the expense of Tesla and its
                    shareholders.[159][160] Tesla directors settled the lawsuit in
                    January 2020, leaving Musk the sole remaining defendant.[161][162]
                    Two years later, the court ruled in Musk's favor.[163]
