      This agreement is between you or the entity you represent and Microsoft
      Corporation, and consists of the terms below, Exhibit A, terms
      incorporated by reference, terms applicable to other Microsoft web sites
      and services that you use and are necessary to use the Services (for
      example, your Microsoft Account), Microsoft API Terms, and the Privacy
      Statement (together, the “Agreement”). If you are entering into this
      Agreement on behalf of an entity, such as your employer, you represent
      that you have the legal authority to bind that entity. If you specify a
      company name in connection with signing up for or ordering a Service, you
      will be deemed to have placed that order and to have entered into this
      Agreement on behalf of that organization or company. Key terms are defined
      in Section 11. By accepting this Agreement, you agree to these terms. If
      you do not accept and comply with this Agreement, you may not use the
      Services. <br />
      <br />
      1. Services. <br />
      a. Right to use. We grant you the right to access and use the Services in
      accordance with this Agreement to design, develop, and test your
      applications to make them available for your Microsoft 365 online
      services, on-premises deployments or for the Microsoft In-product Store
      and/or AppSource. You may not use the Services for production use.
      <br />
      b. User Plan. Each user of the Microsoft 365 Developer portion of the
      Developer Services must be allocated an individual User Plan, whether they
      access the service directly or indirectly. <br />
      <br />
      c. Manner of use. You may not: <br />
      <br />
      i. reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or work around technical
      limitations in the Services, except to the extent that applicable law
      permits it despite these limitations; <br />
      <br />
      ii. disable, tamper with or otherwise attempt to circumvent any mechanism
      that limits your use of the Services; <br />
      <br />
      iii. rent, lease, lend, resell, transfer, or sublicense any Services or
      portion thereof to or for third parties, except as explicitly permitted
      herein or in license terms that accompany any Services component; <br />
      <br />
      iv. use the Services for any purpose that is unlawful or prohibited by
      this Agreement; or <br />
      <br />
      v. use the Services in any manner that could damage, disable, overburden,
      or impair any Microsoft service, or the network(s) connected to any
      Microsoft service, or interfere with any other party’s use and enjoyment
      of any Services. <br />
      <br />
      d. Updates. We may make changes to the Services from time to time,
      including: the availability of features; how long, how much or how often
      any given feature may be used; and feature dependencies upon other
      services or software. <br />
      <br />
      e. Preview features. We may make features available on a Preview basis.
      Previews are provided “AS-IS”. Previews may be subject to reduced or
      different security, compliance, privacy, availability, reliability, and
      support commitments, as further explained in the Privacy Statement, and
      any additional notices provided with the Preview. We may change or
      discontinue Previews at any time without notice. We also may choose not to
      release a Preview into “General Availability”. <br />
